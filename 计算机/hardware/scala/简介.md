# scala是一种面向对象型的语言
1. Variables are objects.
1. Constants in the sense of *Scala's* `val` declarative are also objects.
1. Even literal values are objects.
1. Even functions themselves are objects. More on this later.
1. Objects are instances of classes.
  1. In fact, in just about every way that matters in Scala, the *object* in *Objected Oriented* will be called an instance.
1. In defining classes, the programmer specifies:
  1. The data (`val`, `var`) associated with the class.
  1. The operations, called methods or functions, that instances of the class can perform.
1. Classes can extend other classes.
  1. The class being extended is the superclass; the extendee is the subclass.
  1. In this case, the subclass inherits the data and methods from the superclass.
  1. There are many useful but controlled ways in which a class may extend or override inherited properties.
1. Classes may inherit from traits. Think of traits as lightweight classes that allow specific, limited ways of inheriting from more than one superclass.  
1. (Singleton) Objects are a special kind of Scala class.
  1. They are not objects as above. Remember, we're calling those instances.
